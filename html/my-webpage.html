                        It is also pronounced as 'Evisaa' and it is celebrated as a World Heritage Site. Ibiza is one of
                        the Balearic islands, an archipelago of Spain in the Mediterranean Sea. It's well known for the
                        lively nightlife in Ibiza Town and Sant Antoni, where major European nightclubs have summer
                        outposts. It’s also home to quiet villages, yoga retreats and beaches, from Platja d'en Bossa,
                        lined with hotels, bars and shops, to quieter sandy coves backed by pine-clad hills found all
                        around the coast.
